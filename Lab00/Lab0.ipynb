    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Why I Chose the MSBA Program at Cal Poly\n",
    "___\n",
    "After completing my Bachelor of Science in Statistics with a cross-disciplinary study in Data Science at Cal Poly, continuing into the MSBA program here felt like a natural next step. I’ve come to genuinely love San Luis Obispo—the vibrant, close-knit, supportive campus community and the balance of natural beauty and innovation make it an incredible place to learn and live.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What drew me to the MSBA program was both the encouragement of several professors who knew my academic strengths and passions, and my own desire to continue building on the technical skills I developed during my undergraduate studies. My Data Science minor was very computer science–heavy, with courses in algorithms, distributed computing, and object-oriented programming. That foundation sparked a deep interest in machine learning—one I wasn’t ready to leave behind.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted a program that would allow me to continue that ML journey, but also equip me with the business acumen and storytelling skills needed to succeed in industry. The MSBA program at Cal Poly, with its focus on real-world applications, collaborative industry projects, and cutting-edge analytics tools, offered exactly that.  Although I entered the program directly from undergrad, I had already gained hands-on experience through Cal Poly led industry projects with the World Bank, where I worked on large-scale datasets, data visualization, and machine learning tasks. These experiences solidified my decision to pursue graduate study and sharpened my interest in applying data to impactful problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Career Goals After MSBA\n",
    "\n",
    "After graduating, my primary goal is to gain industry experience—particularly in roles that allow me to blend analytical problem-solving, business insight, and creativity. I’m excited by positions in e-commerce, retail analytics, and social media, where data is used to shape customer experience, forecast trends, and optimize digital strategies.  Companies that stand out to me include Etsy, Pinterest, TikTok, and retail brands under the URBN group like Anthropologie and Free People. I also have a strong interest in working for online education platforms like Chegg, where the mission of accessible learning aligns closely with my personal values and interests in education.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of location, I would love to stay in California, particularly in cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco where tech, retail, and media industries are thriving. However, I’m also open to relocating—especially to Tennessee, where my parents plan to retire post-2025.  Longer-term, I hope to achieve financial independence that will eventually allow me to pursue a PhD—an opportunity I want to take on when I’m more established and ready to immerse myself in research. For now, my focus is on building the experience, knowledge, and confidence needed to contribute meaningfully to the data science field in industry."
