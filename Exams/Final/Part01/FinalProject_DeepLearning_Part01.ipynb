    "Welcome to your **\"Choose Your Own Deep Learning Adventure\"**! This final project gives you the flexibility to explore deep learning topics of your choosing, while still grounding your work in modern Keras/TensorFlow practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore deep learning topics not fully covered in the course.**\n",
    "- **Create two new, well-documented Keras examples** that follow modern best practices.\n",
    "- **Pitch deep learning as a business analytics tool**, targeting real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit **two separate Jupyter notebooks**, each containing one of your custom Keras examples. Both should follow the structure and style found on [keras.io/examples](https://keras.io/examples/), with the following considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each Example Should: https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/movielens_recommendations_transformers/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a **new dataset** (different from the original Keras example, and different between your two examples).\n",
    "- Be **shorter than 300 lines of code**, *excluding data wrangling and preprocessing*.\n",
    "- Be **clearly and thoroughly commented**.\n",
    "- Include **rich explanatory narrative text** that makes the notebook accessible to students who have completed GSB 544.\n",
    "- Reflect **modern Keras/TensorFlow best practices**, mirroring those seen in official examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are **not required** to write your model from scratch. Instead, feel free to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select existing Keras examples and reimplement them using a **new dataset** and **improved narrative**.\n",
    "- Modify architectures, loss functions, or evaluation metrics where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "Your examples should demonstrate how deep learning can be used in **business analytics** contexts. Potential domains include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image recognition\n",
    "- Natural language processing\n",
    "- Customer relationship management\n",
    "- Recommendation systems\n",
    "- Bioinformatics\n",
    "- Medical image analysis\n",
    "- Financial fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended sources for finding your datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)\n",
    "- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)\n",
    "- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n",
